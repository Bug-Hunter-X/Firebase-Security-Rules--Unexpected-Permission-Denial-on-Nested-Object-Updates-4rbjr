# Firebase Security Rules Bug: Unexpected Permission Denial on Nested Object Updates

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Firebase Realtime Database security rules where updates to deeply nested objects are unexpectedly denied, even with seemingly correct rules in place.  The problem arises from the interaction between the rule evaluation and the data's nested structure.  The provided JavaScript code illustrates the issue and its resolution.

## Problem Description

The bug involves Firebase failing to properly evaluate security rules when updating fields within a deeply nested JSON structure.  Even if the rules seem to grant the necessary permissions at a higher level, the write operation may be rejected.

## Solution

The solution involves restructuring the security rules to explicitly cover the nested fields.  This might require adjusting the rules to recursively allow access to sub-objects, or using wildcard characters where appropriate.
