The issue stems from an unusual interaction between Firebase's Realtime Database security rules and the way data is structured.  Specifically, when attempting to update nested objects within a deeply nested structure, the rules might incorrectly deny writes even if they appear to be correctly configured. This occurs because of how Firebase evaluates the rules in conjunction with the data structure. For example, consider the following structure and rule:

```json
data {
  "users": {
    "uid1": {
      "profile": {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "address": {
          "street": "123 Main St",
          "city": "Anytown"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

```

```
  rules_version = '2';
  service cloud.firestore {
    match /databases/{database}/documents { 
      match /users/{userId}/profile { 
          allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == userId; 
      }
    }
  }
}
```

When attempting to update the `city` field, the rule evaluation might fail because the rule only explicitly covers the `profile` level, not nested fields.  Firebase's rule engine might not automatically descend into nested structures correctly in all situations, leading to unexpected permission denials.
